The World of Polybius

The Start Of the World

	"While many ponder "where", well, more correctly, "when" the universe started, other form theories. Tales of gods among us, of ancient primordial beings, or of us inside a virtual simulation as it's playthings. We can not be sure.
	If we can be sure about one thing, then it is that we are searching a nail inside a haybale for answers."
